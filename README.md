# Straw Hat Team Comprehensive API and Database Design

## I. Introduction

This document outlines the API and database design for a comprehensive SaaS platform. The platform includes features such as user authentication, organization management, payments, messaging, and various user-centric functionalities.

Technology Stack:
- Backend: FastAPI
- Database: [  PostgreSQL, MySQL]
- API Documentation: OpenAPI 3.0.0

## II. API Design

Our API is designed using OpenAPI 3.0.0 specification. It provides a comprehensive set of endpoints to interact with various features of the SaaS platform.

### Key Endpoints:

1. Authentication
   - POST /auth/signup
   - POST /auth/login
   - POST /auth/social-login/{provider}
   - POST /auth/magic-link
   - POST /auth/reset-password

2. User Management
   - GET /users
   - POST /users
   - GET /users/{userId}
   - PUT /users/{userId}
   - DELETE /users/{userId}

3. Organization Management
   - GET /organizations
   - POST /organizations
   - GET /organizations/{orgId}
   - PUT /organizations/{orgId}
   - DELETE /organizations/{orgId}

4. Payments
   - POST /payments/stripe
   - POST /payments/flutterwave
   - POST /payments/lemonsqueezy

5. Messaging
   - POST /messages/email
   - GET /messages/templates
   - POST /messages/templates

## III. Database Design

Our database is designed to support all the features of the SaaS platform efficiently. It includes tables for users, organizations, roles, payments, content management, and more.

### Key Tables:

1. users
2. organizations
3. user_org
4. roles
5. user_role
6. social_accounts
7. payments
8. email_templates
9. user_settings
10. content_pages
11. invites
<!-- 12. user_data -->
12. waitlist_entries
13. notifications
14. blog_posts
15. activity_logs
<!-- 16. content_page -->

## IV. Implementation Details

- Architecture: [e.g., Microservices, Monolithic]
- Authentication: JWT-based authentication for API endpoints
- Background Jobs: [e.g., Celery for asynchronous tasks]
- Caching: [e.g., Redis for caching frequently accessed data]

## V. Setup and Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/dammycute/straw_hat_team.git
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment.
    ```sh
        python3 -m venv .venv
    ```
3. Activate virtual environment.
    ```sh
        source /path/to/venv/bin/activate`
    ```
4. Install project dependencies `pip install -r requirements.txt`

5. Create a .env file by copying the .env.sample file
    `cp .env.sample .env`

6. Set up the database:
   ```sh
    alembic init alembic
   ```
   ```sh
    alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Initial migration"
   ```
    ```sh
    alembic upgrade head
   ```

7. Start server.
    ```sh
    python main.py
    ```

8. Access the API documentation:
   ```
   [URL or command to access API documentation]
   ```
