# Straw Hat Team Comprehensive API and Database Design

## I. Introduction

This document outlines the API and database design for a comprehensive SaaS platform. The platform includes features such as user authentication, organization management, payments, messaging, and various user-centric functionalities.

Technology Stack:
- Backend: FastAPI

## IV. Implementation Details

- Architecture: [e.g., Microservices, Monolithic]
- Authentication: JWT-based authentication for API endpoints
- Background Jobs: [e.g., Celery for asynchronous tasks]
- Caching: [e.g., Redis for caching frequently accessed data]

## V. Setup and Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/dammycute/straw_hat_team.git
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment.
    ```sh
        python3 -m venv .venv
    ```
3. Activate virtual environment.
    ```sh
        source /path/to/venv/bin/activate`
    ```
4. Install project dependencies `pip install -r requirements.txt`

5. Create a .env file by copying the .env.sample file
    `cp .env.sample .env`

6. Set up the database:
   ```sh
    alembic init alembic
   ```
   ```sh
    alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Initial migration"
   ```
    ```sh
    alembic upgrade head
   ```

7. Start server.
